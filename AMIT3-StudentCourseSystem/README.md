# AMIT3-StudentCourseSystem

This project is part of the AMIT3 training program, focusing on learning **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)** through practical implementation.

## Project Goals

- Practice writing clean, structured code using Object-Oriented Design principles.
- Understand and implement the relationships between key classes:
  - **Student Class**
  - **Course Class**
  - **System Manager Class**
- Learn how to visualize class relationships using [draw.io](https://draw.io/).

## Key Concepts

- **Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Composition**
- Managing course enrollments and student information
- Building a simple management system to handle courses and students
- Creating UML class diagrams to plan and organize design

## Tools Used

- Python 
- draw.io for class diagram visualization

## Notes

- The system allows you to add/remove students and courses, enroll students in courses, and manage data efficiently.
- Great practice for real-world applications in both **software engineering** and **data-centric** systems.
